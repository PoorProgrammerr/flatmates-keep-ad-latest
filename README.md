#🏠 Tampermonkey Script for Flatmates: Always on Top 🏠

Are you tired of paying for a subscription to keep your flatmate ad on top on flatmates.com.au? Look no further! Our Tampermonkey script ensures your ad is always the first one to appear when other users search for a flatmate, without spending a single dollar.
#How it Works 🤖

Our script uses automation to refresh your flatmate ad at regular intervals, ensuring that it always appears at the top of the search results. This increases the visibility of your ad, making it more likely for potential roommates to find and contact you.
#How to Use 📝

    Fork and clone this repository to your local machine.
    Open the flatmates_ad_on_top.js file and copy its contents.
    Open Tampermonkey and create a new userscript.
    Paste the script contents into the editor and save the script.
    Go to your flatmate ad on flatmates.com.au and the script will automatically start refreshing your ad.
